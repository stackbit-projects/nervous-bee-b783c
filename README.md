# Universal Nextjs Theme

This is Stackbit's "Universal" theme built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and
powered by content stored in files.

## Develop Locally

1. [Create a site](https://app.stackbit.com/create?theme=https://github.com/stackbit-themes/universal-nextjs&utm_source=theme-readme&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stackbit_themes) from this theme using Stackbit.

1. Once finished, you will be redirected to Stackbit Studio where you will be
   able to edit the content using the free on-page editing experience, and
   publish new versions of your site.

1. To further develop your site, clone the generated repository.

1. Install dependencies

       run npm install

1. Start the Next.js local development server:

        npm run develop

1. Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in the browser to see
   your site. You can now edit the site contents, and the browser will
   live-update your changes. ðŸŽ‰
